				<h2 class="center"> Final Evaluation Results </h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px;">There were a few iterations we went through before deciding on our final implementation. For example, we attempted to implement a decision tree so that our application could adapt to user's brain waves. Based on our observations, however, users became frustrated that the application didn't work out-of-the-box and that it needed to be trained.</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px;">Here are the questions we asked our testers:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>On a scale of 1-10, what would you rate the accuracy?</li>
					<li>On a scale of 1-10, what would you rate the interface?</li>
					<li>What worked well?</li>
					<li>What could be improved?</li>
					<li>Would you use this headset?</li>
					<li>If yes, why? If no, what improvements would it take for you to use it?</li>
				</ol>

			<div class="column1">
				<h3>Accuracy</h3>
				<blockquote><p>It worked well when I was zoning out while everyone was talking, and when I was just staring at the whiteboard.</p></blockquote>
				<blockquote><p>It's accurate in terms of detecting when I'm paying attention and when I'm feeling tired.</p></blockquote>

				<h3>Alert</h3>
				<blockquote><p>The sharpness of the alarm tone would wake me up.</p></blockquote>

				<h3>Accuracy</h3>

				<h2 class="center">Would you use this headset?</h2>
				<h3>80% of our testers said "Yes"</h3>
				<p>However, most of them cited under the contingency that the headset were made more comfortable. When probing for why they would wear it, we discovered that people really value their lives and would wear the headset for safety reasons. This is consistent with our needfinding interviews.</p>
