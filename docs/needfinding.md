<p>Our needfinding is three-fold. We want to target University of Rochester resources to be our test subjects, since they are the most convenient to us. Thus, our first step was to survey the general student population. Secondly, we interviewed a few students. And lastly, we will be interviewing a professor from the BCS department.</p>

<h2>Survey Information</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom:15px;">On November 1, 2017, we pushed out a short and simple survey consisting of eight questions to the general student population. We posted in Class of 2018, Class of 2019, Class of 2020, and Class of 2021 Facebook pages. In addition, we emailed it to UR friends whom do not have have a Facebook account, to get their perspectives as well. The goal of the survey was to ascertain the behaviors and attitudes towards driving and to find out if there are specific needs that have not yet been addressed. As of November 9, 2017 we received 52 responses because of our persistence.</p>
