# OpenBCIBLE
Android app for testing BLE connection to OpenBCI Cyton and Ganglion Boards

This project is a extension of https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothLeGatt configured for the OpenBCI boards (http://openbci.com/) namely Ganglion and Cyton.

The app should show the available boards, and correctly identify the SERVICE, SEND and RECEIVE characteristics for the boards.
Click the SEND characteristic to toggle-write 'b' or 's' to the board.
